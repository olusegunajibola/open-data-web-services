# open-data-web-services

## Introduction
Data is a big part of the world we live in. Today, human activities give a lot of data that can be studied. As a result, it is important to have software that can properly put this data into formats that can be read by the computer system. This is where the concept of data cleaning and web services comes into place. Data cleaning ensures that the “dirt” in data has been rid
of while web services enable human/computer interaction with this data.

The  REST  (REpresentational  State  Transfer) web  service  is  a  way of  implementing  web services. The key objective of a web service is to allow communication between a service provider and the consumer.

In this project, we implement the process of data integration using a REST web service. To
achieve this, we need to have

a)   a resource (i.e dataset/database),

b) some URIs (unique resource identifiers) that refer to attributes in the resource using
the resource description framework (RDF) concepts and semantics of subject, object,
and predicate,

c)   the usage of HTTP methods (i.e GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Objectives

The following are our objectives in this project:

a)   Acquire at least two datasets that are related with an open license.

b)  Clean, enrich and link the datasets.

c)   Define sets of SPARQL queries for retrieving relevant information from the linked
datasets.

d)  Define a REST web service which exposes and combines the linked datasets.

e)   Define a JAVA Client which interacts with the web service.
